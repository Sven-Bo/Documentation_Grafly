# Which chart types are supported in Grafly?

Grafly currently supports a variety of chart types including:

* Bar Chart (Clustered, Vertical & Horizontal)
* Line Chart
* Area Chart
* Pie Chart
* Scatter Chart
* Radar Chart
* Gauge Chart (with single or multiple zones)
* Simple Table View

I’m continuously adding more features and chart types as development progresses. If you need a specific chart type that isn’t available yet, feel free to submit your suggestion [here](https://grafly-feedback.pythonandvba.com/?swcfpc=1).
